## Overview

This page is made with HTML, CSS and JS. I don't use and framework or preprocessors. Firs I made HTML template and added content, then style it and after this wrtie JS for DOM manipultion. Here is nothins to calculate or code something hard, it's just DOM manipulation. JS takes value from HTML button and writes it in second containers 'P' element, also hides one container and shows another, wirh rating number, which is taken from button value. Work was not too easy for me, because it was my first try in JS with DOM manimulation, but I made it.
